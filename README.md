Files Description:
1. All HTML code is in index.html
2. Used SCSS for this project and the built file is stye.css
3. Dami data is stored in product.json
4. All Javascript are in the script.js file

If you want to run the project locally then need to run index.html from the live server. Otherwise, CORS error will be occured. 

Simplely you can open this codebase in VSCODE and install live-server plugin. After that open index.html through the live server. 

To ignore this you can easily browse index.html from https://syedshahriaz.github.io/vodus/index.html
